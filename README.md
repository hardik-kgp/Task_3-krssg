# Task_3-krssg
Task3 of task round 2019
SO HERE IS MY STRATEGY!!!

first I calculated the distance and player number of opponent.If the distance is to less Stand Still else it will fall down.
THen if my distance to ball is less than the distance of closest player to ball then I can approach the ball before he can and I
can kick the ball.
If I am close to the ball as well as to the Target(goal) then I kick the ball hard towards the target.
IF none of the conditions are satisfied I simply dribble it towards the goal.!
